Quick index of what's in this folder and when to load each file.

| File | When You Need It | What's Inside |
|------|-----------------|---------------|
| `signal-heuristics.md` | During any analysis — classification rules, formulas, thresholds | Era boundary signals (5 signals, weights), frustration levels (L1–L4), batch merge detection, formulas (LVI, MER, FCR, ADR, burst-to-gap), commit type taxonomy (conventional + non-conventional fallback), AI trust trajectory indicators |
| `output-schemas.md` | When you want structured JSON output instead of prose | JSON schemas for: Actuals (learning narrative), Gaps (knowledge gap analysis), Plan (personalized curriculum), Temporal Behavior, AI Maturity. Includes validation rules (confidence levels, date formats, null handling) |
| `html-report-spec.md` | When delivering final output — default for all reports | Complete HTML/CSS design system: dark theme palette, typography, 8 chart specifications (area chart, heatmap, donut, bar chart, scatter plot, timeline, stacked bar, sparkline), component styles, responsive rules, auto-open command, data population rules |
| `verified-creators.md` | When building The Plan (Mode 3) | Five verified creators with their channels, expertise areas, search terms, and known content. The specialist scopes all content recommendations to these sources only. Never hallucinates URLs or video titles. |
| `data-enrichment.md` | When external learning data is available (optional) | Google Takeout setup instructions (YouTube watch/search history), supported alternative sources (Udemy, Coursera, Kindle, browser history), comparison table: what git-only can detect vs. what Takeout unlocks |

**Load order:**
1. `signal-heuristics.md` — Always relevant. Load when classifying eras, calculating metrics, or detecting frustration.
2. `output-schemas.md` — Load only when the user requests structured/JSON output. Default is prose.
3. `html-report-spec.md` — Load when delivering final output (Phase 5). Default for all reports unless user requests text only.
4. `verified-creators.md` — Load when building The Plan (Mode 3). Scopes all content recommendations to five verified sources.
5. `data-enrichment.md` — Load only when the user mentions external learning data (YouTube, courses) or asks about learning latency measurement.

All files are designed for selective loading per the ICM Layer 3 pattern. None are required for a basic git-only analysis.
